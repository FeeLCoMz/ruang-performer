# Ruang Performer - User Management Best Practices

## 👥 User Management System

### User Types & Their Needs

#### 1. **Solo Musician** 🎸
- Single user per band
- Full control over all content
- No member management needed
- Simple workflow

**Setup:**
```
User creates account → Creates band → Becomes band owner
```

---

#### 2. **Band with Members** 🎼
- One owner/manager
- Multiple musicians
- Shared songs & setlists
- Collaborative planning

**Setup:**
```
Owner creates account
→ Creates band
→ Invites members
→ Members join band
→ Everyone sees songs/setlists
```

---

#### 3. **Multiple Bands** 🎵
- One user in different bands
- Different roles per band
- Personal profile
- Cross-band analytics

**Setup:**
```
User creates account
→ Joins/Creates multiple bands
→ Has different roles per band
→ Personal dashboard shows all bands
```

## 🚨 User Safety & Security

### Password Requirements
- ✅ Minimum 8 characters
- ✅ At least one uppercase letter
- ✅ At least one number
- ✅ At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
- ✅ Not same as email/username

### Account Security

```javascript
// Password hashing
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

// Hash password on registration
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, 10);

// Verify password on login
const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hashedPassword);

// Store hashedPassword in database (NEVER plain text)
```

### Session Security

```javascript
// JWT Token settings
const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId, email, role },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '7d' } // Token expires in 7 days
);

// Verify token on each request
try {
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
} catch (err) {
  // Token expired or invalid
}
```

### Two-Factor Authentication (Future)

```
1. User enables 2FA
2. App generates QR code
3. User scans with authenticator app
4. On login:
   - User enters password
   - System sends 2FA code to app
   - User enters code
   - Access granted
```
